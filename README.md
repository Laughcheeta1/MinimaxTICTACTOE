# Minimax In TIC TAC TOE

Rules of the game:
As this is going to be played against the AI, it will be a single player game.
You get to decide whether to go first or second.

The game is played on a grid of your choosing, the game will prompt you for the amount of rows and columns you want to play with.

Note that if you put a value less than 3 for either the column or the row, the game will default it to be 3 instead.

Contrary to the simple tic tac toe, the amount of values you need to connect to win, depends on the amount of rows and columns you choose. Automatically the minmum of these will be chosen.
For example:
    If you choose a 6x8 grid (6 rows and 8 columns), you will need to connect 6 values to win.


This is a practice of basic AI algortihms like minimax.
The goal is to make a basic AI that can play Tic Tac Toe.

And for wich ever point in the game, it will give you a prediction of who is going to be the winner.

The AI always makes the optimal solution (As per Minimax algorithm).
